# smidi
MIDI library with MIDI Clock synchronization support.

Still in development...
- [x] ALSA-related stuff moved out of the "generic" Linux implementation (MidiInPortLinux and MidiOutPortLinux).
- [ ] I want to use [watcher](https://github.com/dissabte/watcher) to take hot plugged MIDI devices into account.
- [ ] MIDI sync is not even started!
- [ ] OS X (CoreMidi)? Some day.
- [ ] Windoes (winmm)? Some day.
